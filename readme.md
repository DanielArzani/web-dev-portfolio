## About Me

My name is Daniel Arzanipour and I've always liked technology (_the software part of it_) and have been interested in its design and creation, an opportunity had presented itself and I decided to give this passion of mine a shot

I'm always looking for new technologies to learn and building clean looking and useful things.

My approach to learning code is, pray about it first -> get as much information as I can about it -> find visual demonstrations of it -> putting it into practice with a small hello world project -> using it in a larger project

One problem with me is how easily I get interested in other things, firebase? Gatsby? .NET? When I see something that I didn't know about before, I want to try and learn it. I've learned from experience that this only leads to not being very proficient in anything so I have to quickly throw those thoughts out of my mind the moment they come in!
